# Hi, this is a hobbyproject where you can control your ToneX Pedal from your browser.

    [Access it as a webpage here!](https://bearwolf.github.io/TonexWebController/)
    1. Connect pedal via cable. Make sure Midi is set to 'Through' or 'Merge' on the tonex.
    2. Choose ToneX as midi device (refesh page if ToneX is not showing).
    3. Choose midichannel if you've changed it.
    DISCLAIMER: The information is one way, the knobs won't know what your settings are until you move them here.
